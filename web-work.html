            This is a website that I created for a small fictitious marketing company. I started creating the 
            site when I was learning HTML &amp; CSS and was originally inspired Lorde’s Pure Heroine album cover. 
            I used that as an inspiration but my inspiration had changed during the project and took a different 
            change than what I had originally intended. I came back to the drawing board and sketched out a 
            new design for the website. I wanted the site to have a minimalist feel with a good contrast between 
            the type and background, why I chose the colors that are currently presented. The pictures are used 
            to as an emphasis as to the work that the company does. While in the biography section since it is a 
            smaller company that has four employees, I decided to create a place for them to each give a statement 
            about who they are and what they do for the company. This site was built using HTML, SASS and jQuery.
            I used Bootstrap 3 for a framework.

            This website came from a challenge that I gave myself. It was to create a website 
            and code it under one day. It's a very simple website, has basic sections, was a 
            great experience to give me restraints and a timeline in a project. The color scheme is 
            dark navy, coral, and white. Mixed with the Abel (sans serif) and Amiri(serif) fonts offered 
            by Google. It was built using Bootstrap 4, which was my first time working with that framework.

            The Movie API project is a website that I created where you can enter the name of a movie and it 
            will get the movie information from the website <a class="project-a" href='http://www.omdbapi.com/'>OMDb API</a> 
            and display information about the movie such as the year the movie was released, rating, runtime, 
            actors, plot and more. It uses AJAX to access the site where all the information is stored to 
            display the information.

            This form is a page that I created to practice working with AJAX. It has a success and fail function

          This was the very first website that I created. I made it using HTML and CSS using the Bootstrap 3 front-end framework, 
          then later after learning jQuery I added some functionality to the menu when it goes to mobile view. 
          I created this site due to my love of coffee and was a great learning experience. I learned the basics of 
          creating a website on my own without any assistance from online learning. It allowed me to get a step into the process 
          of creating a website.

            This is a website that I created for a small fictitious marketing company. I started creating the 
            site when I was learning HTML &amp; CSS and was originally inspired Lorde’s Pure Heroine album cover. 
            I used that as an inspiration but my inspiration had changed during the project and took a different 
            change than what I had originally intended. I came back to the drawing board and sketched out a 
            new design for the website. I wanted the site to have a minimalist feel with a good contrast between 
            the type and background, why I chose the colors that are currently presented. The pictures are used 
            to as an emphasis as to the work that the company does. While in the biography section since it is a 
            smaller company that has four employees, I decided to create a place for them to each give a statement 
            about who they are and what they do for the company. This site was built using HTML, SASS and jQuery.
            I used Bootstrap 3 for a framework.
